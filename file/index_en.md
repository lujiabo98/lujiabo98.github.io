# About Me

Here is **Jiabo Lu (Âç¢ÂÆ∂Ê≥¢)**üòÑ.

I am a PhD student majoring in **hydrology and water resources** at [Hohai University](https://www.hhu.edu.cn/), supervised by [A/Prof. Xiaohua Xiang](https://jszy.hhu.edu.cn/xxh/) and [Prof. Chuanhai Wang](https://jszy.hhu.edu.cn/wch/). Oct 2023 - Oct 2024, I served as an Honorary Visitor at the [Environmental Hydrology and Water Resources](https://infrastructure.eng.unimelb.edu.au/research/water) Group of [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), supervised by [Prof. QJ Wang](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/241-q-j-wang). 

Feel free to visit my [**Resume**](https://lujiabo98.github.io/file/CV_JiaboLu_en.pdf) and [**Blog**](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43012724?type=blog) to learn more, I would love to chat and collaborateü§ù.

## Research Interests

- Flood inundation prediction
- Flow field reconstruction
- Surrogate model
- [My latest research proposal (Dec 2022)](https://lujiabo98.github.io/file/proposal_2022.pdf)üîó

My current research focuses on **real-time flood inundation prediction** that can rapidly provide flood extent, water depth hydrographs and flow velocity field on floodplains. Flood disasters influence the life of everybody. I wish to devote to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
