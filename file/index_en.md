## Research Interests

- Flood inundation prediction
- Physics-informed surrogate model
- Machine Learning
- Reduced order model
- Flood disaster warning
- [My latest research proposal (Dec 2022)](https://lujiabo98.github.io/file/proposal_2022.pdf)üîó

My current research focuses on flood inundation prediction that can rapidly provide flood extent and water depth hydrographs on floodplains. My interests are on the physics-informed **Machine Learning** and its applications in **flood forecasting**. In a word, flood disasters influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
