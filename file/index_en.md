## Research Interests

- Flood inundation prediction
- Flood hazard mapping
- Deep Learning
- Reduced order model
- [My latest research proposal (Dec 2022)](https://lujiabo98.github.io/file/proposal_2022.pdf)üîó

My current research focuses on **real-time flood inundation prediction** that can rapidly provide flood extent and water depth hydrographs on floodplains. My interests are on the combination of **flood inundation prediction** and **Deep Learning**. In a word, flood disasters influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
