# Hobbies

## Reading

<br>I enjoy reading about sociology, literature, and philosophy. I have read over 100 books. For books that I feel deeply about, I will write about them. I have a plan to read one introductory book for each discipline with a view to developing my critical thinking and interdisciplinary skills.

## Watching

I like to watch comedies, action movies, westerns and old American movies. Drama entertains me, action and westerns excite me, and old movies slow me down and make me think. I like watching movies and TV shows with my girlfriend, Lei(Laywoo) Wu. She is my love. We spent a lot of happy time together.

## Programing

I like to realize my ideas in code. I think it's cool. I am proficient in C++, Python and MATLAB languages and have used them to implement several models, algorithms and automation projects. I love the open source culture and contribute to it.

## Writing

<br>There must be **something truly magical** about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].
