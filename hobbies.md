<br>I enjoy reading about sociology, literature, and philosophy. I have read over 100 books. For books that I feel deeply about, I will write about them. I have a plan to read one introductory book for each discipline with a view to developing my critical thinking and interdisciplinary skills.

## Watching

I like to watch comedies, action movies, westerns and social news. Drama entertains me, action and westerns excite me, and social news slow me down and make me think. I like watching movies and TV shows with my girlfriend, Lei(Laywoo) Wu. She is my love. We spent a lot of happy time together.

## Programing

I like to realize my ideas in code. I think it's cool. I am proficient in C++, Python and MATLAB languages and have used them to implement several models, algorithms and automation projects. I love the open source culture and contribute to it.

## Writing

I like to record my thoughts through writing. I sometimes write some reading thoughts, movie watching thoughts and programming development blogs. I'm happy to share what I've learned with others and make a small contribution to the Chinese Internet community.

I am a badminton beginner and I participate in badminton activities in my subject group every weekend. Playing badminton can make me relax from my stressful study life, though I am not good at it.
